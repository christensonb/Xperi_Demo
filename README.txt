# Xperi_Demo
This is a demo challenge for xperi, to create a Flask application.


Using Python3, implement a simple multi-account bank register.
It should allow for the number and names of accounts to be
configured, and should support:
  1. Deposit to an account
  2. Withdrawal from an account
  3. Transfer from one account to another.

It should keep a history, present current, balances and a way to view the transaction
history of the account.

I am *not* interested in clever code, a polished result, a sophisticated user UI/UX (ie:
some simple CLI or CMD interpreter is what I expect), or conformance to accounting
standards :)

What I'm looking for here is to get a feeling for:
  A. Your coding *style*
  B. How you organize your code
  C. Your data structures.

The program should persist the data between runs, but I don't care how that is done or
whether or not it is efficient.

The code sample should include unit tests using the unit-test module. The unit tests
are as important as the code.

Don't spend too much time on thisâ€¦

Once the code is done, zip it all and send it. After reviewing the code, we will review
the code with you and ask questions as well as discuss how to implement some
changes as if this were a code review situation.
